# Sudoku-solver

Sudoku-solver is an application developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis. It provides environment for a user to put in a sudoku puzzle and get feedback on which logical stragecy he should apply next, with an explanation. It aims not to provide a solution, but teach the user what clues should have been used to progress.

This application is currently unmaintained and undeployed. The code reflects the fact that this was my first real project, and contains unclean code.

Only available in the Czech language.
